Inserts two modelines with the currently active filetype and tabulator settings.

Can be used for:

 - a quick overview of the file settings (like is the file dos or unix format). 
 - to set the file setting (just change the settings which are wrong).
 - to make shure the file settings stay put when the file is saved and loaded.

Can be easily exdended for more settings - just as you want it.
